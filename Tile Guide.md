#Tile Guide
This guide is just a reference for the order in which the tiles should exist to be referenced correctly by the autotile script.

The order is a pattern, but just in case, he's the definitive guide.  The X in the center is the block whose texture is being determined. The B's around the center block represent the other blocks present. A '.' represents a space that could either contain a block, or not; it doesn't make a difference to the appearance of the center block.

Tile 0:
